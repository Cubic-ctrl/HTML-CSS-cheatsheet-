HTML Cheatsheet
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create web pages. HTML uses tags to identify different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and lists.

HTML Tags

HTML tags are used to identify different elements of a web page. Tags are always enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). The opening tag identifies the element, and the closing tag closes the element.

Some common HTML tags include:

_#<h1>: This tag is used to create a heading level 1.
<p>: This tag is used to create a paragraph.
<img>: This tag is used to insert an image into a web page.
<ul>: This tag is used to create an unordered list.
<ol>: This tag is used to create an ordered list.
HTML Attributes

HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an HTML element. Attributes are always enclosed in quotation marks (" and ").

Some common HTML attributes include:

id: This attribute is used to identify an HTML element.
class: This attribute is used to group HTML elements together.
style: This attribute is used to style an HTML element.
href: This attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.
src: This attribute is used to specify the URL of an image.
HTML Source Code

HTML source code is the code that is used to create a web page. HTML source code is written in plain text, and it can be opened and edited in any text editor.

Here is an example of HTML source code:

Code snippet
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is my first web page!</h1>
<p>I am so excited to learn HTML!</p>
</body>
</html>

When this HTML source code is loaded into a web browser, it will display the following web page:

Code snippet
<h1>This is my first web page!</h1>
<p>I am so excited to learn HTML!</p>

CSS Cheatsheet
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to control the presentation of web pages. CSS uses rules to specify the appearance of HTML elements, such as their color, font, size, and position.

CSS Rules

CSS rules are used to specify the appearance of HTML elements. Rules are made up of a selector and a declaration block. The selector identifies the HTML element that the rule applies to, and the declaration block contains the properties and values that are used to style the element.

Some common CSS properties include:

color: This property is used to set the color of an HTML element.
font-size: This property is used to set the font size of an HTML element.
font-family: This property is used to set the font family of an HTML element.
text-align: This property is used to set the alignment of text within an HTML element.
margin: This property is used to set the margin of an HTML element.
CSS Source Code

CSS source code is the code that is used to style a web page. CSS source code is written in plain text, and it can be opened and edited in any text editor.

Here is an example of CSS source code:

Code snippet
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: Arial;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 10px;
}

When this CSS source code is applied to the HTML source code from the previous section, it will display the following web page:

Code snippet
<h1 style="color:red;font-size:20px;font-family:Arial;">Hello World!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;margin:10px;">learn HTML with Cubic!</p>
